# Bank_Subscription_Analysis
**Using PowerBI to Visualise the effectiveness of a Marketing Campaign for the Subscription of a term deposit**

>### Context
The Portuguese Bank Subscription Dataset (Bank Marketing Dataset) contains client, financial, and campaign-related data from a Portuguese bank's direct marketing calls, aiming to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.
This project aims to use **Power BI** to visualize which **personal attributes and demographic factors** are most likely to influence a client's decision to subscribe to a term deposit. This dashboard will aid in customer segmentation, enabling the bank to identify key demographics and tailor more targeted and effective marketing campaigns in the future.

>### Dashboard Creation
**CHARTS:** The dashboard features **four main charts** that categorize potential customers by their **age group, job type, marital status, and education level**.

**SLICERS:** To visualize the different attributes that may influence subscription decisions, the slicers provide options to filter by **personal loan status, housing loan status, loan defaults, and whether the customer successfully subscribed to the deposit**.

**OTHER VISUALS:** Other visuals display the **total number of customers** and the **subscription rate for each customer segment**, adjusting based on the selected filters.
